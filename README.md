To share your app as a gist:

Copy and paste your app.R files to the gist web page.
Note the URL that GitHub gives the gist.
Once you’ve made a gist, your users can launch the app with runGist("<gist number>") where "<gist number>" is the number that appears at the end of your Gist’s web address.

Here is an example of an app hosted as a gist. You could launch this app with:

runGist("eb3470beb1c0252bd0289cbc89bcf36f")
